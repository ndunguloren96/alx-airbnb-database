## üìÅ Scripts

Each `.sql` file in the `/scripts` directory focuses on a specific SQL concept.

| Script File                               | Description                                                                 |
|------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `joins_queries.sql`                      | Demonstrates usage of `INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`, and `FULL OUTER JOIN`.    |
| `subqueries.sql`                         | Provides examples of **correlated** and **non-correlated subqueries**.      |
| `aggregations_and_window_functions.sql`  | Shows how to use **aggregate functions** and **window functions** for analytics. |
| `database_index.sql`                     | Contains SQL statements to **create indexes** that improve query performance. |
| `perfomance.sql`                         | Includes a **complex query** and its **optimized** version.                 |
| `partitioning.sql`                       | Demonstrates how to **partition large tables** for better performance.      |

## üìÑ Reports

Detailed Markdown reports that explain and document performance strategies and outcomes.

| Report File                      | Summary                                                                 |
|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `index_performance.md`          | Explains the purpose of indexes created and the **expected performance gains**. |
| `optimization_report.md`        | Documents the **process of optimizing a complex SQL query**, with metrics. |
| `partition_performance.md`      | Discusses **table partitioning**, when to use it, and **performance benefits**. |
| `performance_monitoring.md`     | Outlines a long-term **strategy for monitoring and refining** database performance. |
